						<h3>Audi RS4 - 2007</h3>
						<p>Typically the RS4 range is associated with car wankers but it's appeal to them originates in the fact that it is a very good car (and it was scene as an alternative to the M3 - like how people opt for Android simply because it's <em>not</em> Apple) <a href="https://www.carsales.com.au/dealer/details/Audi-RS4-2007/OAG-AD-14710348/?Cr=0">Link to Carsales</a></p>

						<h3>The 'Stang - 2017</h3>
						<p> Not a roadster but definitely a motoring icon - with a design that tips its hat to the original you'll get the feeling of driving the ol '68 'stang but with the modern interior and safety improvements; so convincing Gayle to join you in jaunts to Montville will be easy.

						<h3>Audi S5 - 2010</h3>
						<p>I have driven the 2008 model and it was one of my all-time favourites; the engine note alone is something to behold - it's effectively the combination of an orgasm and velvet. It is slightly faked in that it has a tuned exhaust but who am I to care.

						<h3>BMW M3 - 2008</h3>
						<p>The E92 is considered to be one of the best incarnations of the M3 - it's the epitome of BMW's sleek curve designs they implemented in the mid 2000s before they started going nuts with creases. Like the RS4 it has a small wanker-ish following.

						<p>
							I've driven a cayman and a cayenne in the past and I can definitely say there's something about Porsches that just feel right, like a good fitting jacket. Good handling, throttle response, great sound. I'm not sure how much this would be to maintain after market but i'm not sure if that's a deciding factor for you.

							Hands down the modern epitome of european roadster. I haven't had the privilege of driving a Z4 but it's one of those strikingly beautiful cars that one could stare at indefinitely and not get tired of it. Like a sunset.

						<p>
							I'm not sure if you're open to rice burners but the 350z is one of my favourite in its class. The 370z has a more square footprint which makes for excellent handling ala the lancia stratos.

						<h3>Mercedes-Benz SLK200 Kompressor - 2010</h3>

						<p>
							I drove a previous version of this car with a v6 and it was weird, fun, but weird. It had all the typical german automaker refinements but driving it felt a little beastly. Like someone had a custom-tailored suit made for a rabid pitbull. From memory they can cost a bit to get serviced but again didn't factor this in when selecting.

						<h3>Fiat 124 Abarth - 2017</h3>

						<p>
							I can't speak first-hand about this car but I can certainly vouch for the Mazda Mx-5 (as it's just a reskinned Mx5 ND) - The fiat 124 was your typical romanticised italian roadster for the people, there were a ton of the classic ones floating about florence when we were there. This modern take (akin to the mustang) allows for historical reminiscing while not having to worry about the lack of headrests, seatbelts, airbags etc of the original model. I can safely say if it were my money i'd go for this or an MX5 in a heartbeat - modern 4cyl sportscars are fun as fuck.

					<section>
						<p>Seriously though, I've driven the MX5 ND and it's all the sportscar one needs and it has one of the most comfortable dirving positions of any "fun" car i've driven - with the exception of the Jaguar F-Type - that thing was the bee's knees... but also many $$$ more... <_<</p>
